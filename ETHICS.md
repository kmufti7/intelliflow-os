# IntelliFlow OS — Ethical AI Considerations

This document describes the ethical considerations and responsible AI practices in IntelliFlow OS.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Transparency over opacity.** Every decision is logged and traceable.
2. **Human oversight preserved.** AI assists, humans decide.
3. **Fail safe, not fail silent.** Errors surface clearly, never hidden.
4. **No unilateral high-stakes decisions.** Critical determinations require human confirmation.

## CareFlow: Healthcare-Specific Considerations

### What CareFlow Does

- Identifies potential care gaps based on patient data and clinical guidelines
- Surfaces findings to clinicians with citations to both patient evidence and guideline evidence
- Schedules follow-up appointments when gaps are detected

### What CareFlow Does NOT Do

| Action | Status | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Diagnose patients | Never | Diagnosis is a licensed clinical act |
| Prescribe treatment | Never | Prescribing requires clinical judgment and licensure |
| Override clinician decisions | Never | AI is advisory, not authoritative |
| Make decisions without citations | Never | Every gap includes patient evidence + guideline evidence |

### Bias Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Guidelines may reflect historical biases | Use current, peer-reviewed clinical guidelines; document sources |
| Extraction errors could affect certain populations differently | Regex-first extraction is deterministic and testable; no learned biases |
| LLM explanations could introduce bias | LLM formats deterministic outputs; does not make clinical decisions |

### Deterministic Reasoning ("Code as Judge")

The "Therefore" pattern ensures:

- Gap detection is computed by Python code, not LLM inference
- `if a1c > 7.0: gap = True` is auditable and reproducible
- LLM only explains the result; it cannot change the decision

This separates **decision logic** (deterministic, auditable) from **communication** (LLM-generated, flexible).

### Governance Enforcement (v2 — KillSwitchGuard)

intelliflow-core v2 extends the "Code as Judge" principle to workflow-level enforcement. GovernanceRule contracts make ethical constraints explicit — each rule carries a required `description` field that documents what the rule enforces in human-readable language. KillSwitchGuard evaluates every registered rule before any LLM node executes. If any rule fails, the workflow halts with a structured failure payload. The system is fail-closed: if a rule's evaluation logic raises an exception, it is treated as a failure — the system errs toward blocking when a guardrail malfunctions, never toward silently passing.

This makes ethical constraints auditable, enforceable at runtime, and self-documenting at the type level.

The WORM audit log (WORMLogRepository) extends ethical accountability from runtime enforcement to permanent record. Every GovernanceRule evaluation — whether passed or failed — is logged to an HMAC-SHA256 hash-chained, append-only store with SQLite-enforced Write-Once immutability. An ethics reviewer can reconstruct exactly which rules fired, which failed, and what state the system was in at the moment of each decision. The fail-closed design (WORMStorageError halts execution on any write failure) ensures that ethical constraints are not just enforced — their enforcement is permanently and tamper-evidently recorded.

## SupportFlow: Customer Service Considerations

### Fairness in Routing

| Design Choice | Rationale |
|---------------|-----------|
| Enum-based classification (POSITIVE/NEGATIVE/QUERY) | Deterministic routing; no learned biases |
| Policy retrieval via keyword matching | Transparent, auditable; no opaque relevance scoring |
| Every response cites policy | Customer can verify response against source |

### Escalation Path

- Negative classifications create tickets for human review
- System does not resolve complaints autonomously
- Human agents have full visibility into AI reasoning via audit logs

---

## Data Ethics

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Minimize data collection | Only collect what's needed for the task |
| PHI stays local | Patient data never transmitted to cloud services |
| Synthetic data for reference implementation testing | No real patient data used in development or demonstration |
| Audit trail transparency | Users can inspect what data was processed and how |

## Limitations and Disclaimers

### CareFlow

- **Not a medical device.** This is a reference implementation for portfolio purposes.
- **Not clinically validated.** Has not undergone clinical trials or FDA review.
- **Synthetic data only.** All patient data is fictional.
- **Guidelines are illustrative.** Real deployment would require integration with authoritative, up-to-date clinical guidelines.

### SupportFlow

- **Not production-hardened.** Production-grade security and scalability.
- **Policies are illustrative.** Real deployment would require integration with actual bank policies.

## Responsible AI Checklist

For production deployment (not current scope):

- [ ] Clinical validation of gap detection rules
- [ ] Bias audit across demographic groups
- [ ] Human-in-the-loop review for high-stakes recommendations
- [ ] Clear user disclosure that AI is involved
- [ ] Appeal/override mechanism for AI recommendations
- [ ] Regular model and guideline updates
- [ ] Incident response plan for AI errors
