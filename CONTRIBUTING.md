# Contributing to IntelliFlow OS

IntelliFlow OS is a production-grade reference architecture for governance-first AI in regulated industries. The platform is open source for transparency, peer review, and educational purposes — so that engineers, architects, and product managers working in banking, healthcare, and other regulated domains can study the patterns and adapt them to their own systems.

We are not actively seeking external contributions at this time. The platform's architecture, test suite, and documentation are tightly coupled through an automated cascade verification system (11 checks across 4 repositories), and maintaining consistency requires coordinated updates across multiple files and repos.

If you find a bug, inaccuracy, or architectural gap, you are welcome to open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/kmufti7/intelliflow-os/issues) for discussion. We review issues regularly and appreciate constructive feedback from practitioners in regulated industries.

Thank you for your interest in IntelliFlow OS.
