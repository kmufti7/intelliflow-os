## Portfolio & Job Search Mode

This project includes non-code deliverables (LinkedIn posts, resume, interview prep, documentation).

### Private Artifacts
* Private artifacts live in `portfolio_writeup/` and `linkedin_experience.md` (both .gitignored).
* Log all private artifact changes to `portfolio_writeup/PRIVATE_CHANGELOG.md` with date and summary.
* Never commit private artifacts to GitHub.

### Operating Docs
* DNA and Context docs live in Claude Project Knowledge, not in this repo.
* Reference their version numbers (e.g., "DNA v1.0", "Context v1.2") when relevant.

### Accuracy Rules
* Before finalizing any content, verify claims against Technical Truth Table in DNA.
* Flag forbidden phrases (see DNA Section 9).
* Confidence levels required for recommendations.

### LinkedIn Posts
* Store drafts in `portfolio_writeup/09_linkedin_posts.md`.
* Track status: Draft → Revised → Final → Posted.
* No student framing ("portfolio project", "demo", "learning").
